# Prodev Mobile App Setup

## Scaffolding Process
1. Initialized the project using `npx create-expo-app@latest .`.
2. Explored the file-based routing system provided by Expo Router.
3. Modified the main screen in `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` to display "First App Created".

## Observations from `reset-project`
When I ran `npm run reset-project`, the following occurred:
- The existing boilerplate code (the default Expo welcome screens) was moved to a new directory called `/app-example`.
- The `/app` directory was cleared to provide a fresh starting point.
- This allows for a clean slate to begin building custom components without being distracted by the default template code.
